        HTML5 isn�t a completely new language created from scratch. It�s an evolutionary rather than revolutionary change in the
        ongoing story of markup. If you are currently creating websites with any version of HTML, you�re already using HTML5.Additionally
        many elements have been created to represent new-age digital media. These include video and audio which are huge
        for multimedia support. In some browsers you may complete form validation directly in HTML. Granted there is still
        a heavy need for jQuery, since there are many software developers who have yet to recognize.
